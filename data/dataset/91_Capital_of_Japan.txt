The current de facto '''capital of Japan''' is Tokyo. In the course of history, the national capital has been in many locations other than Tokyo.

==History==
Traditionally, the home of the Emperor is considered the capital. From 794 through 1868, the Emperor lived in Heian-kyō, modern-day Kyoto.  After 1868, the seat of the Government of Japan and the location of the Emperor's home was moved to Edo, which it renamed Tokyo.

In 1941, the Ministry of Education published the .

===Law and custom===
While no laws have designated Tokyo as the Japanese capital, many laws have defined a  that incorporates Tokyo. Article 2 of the  of 1956 states: "In this Act, the term 'capital area' shall denote a broad region comprising both the territory of the Tokyo Metropolis as well as outlying regions designated by cabinet order." This implies that the government has designated Tokyo as the capital of Japan, although (again) it is not explicitly stated, and the definition of the "capital area" is purposely restricted to the terms of that specific law.

Other laws referring to this "capital area" include the  and the .

This term for capital was never used to refer to Kyoto. Indeed, ''shuto'' came into use during the 1860s as a gloss of the English term "capital".

The Ministry of Education published a book called "History of the Restoration" in 1941.  This book referred to  without talking about . A contemporary history textbook states that the Meiji government "moved the capital (''shuto'') from Kyoto to Tokyo" without using the ''sento'' term.

As of 2007, there is a movement to transfer the government functions of the capital from Tokyo while retaining Tokyo as the ''de facto'' capital, with the Gifu-Aichi region, the Mie-Kio region and other regions submitting bids for a ''de jure'' capital. Officially, the relocation is referred to as "capital ''functions'' relocation" instead of "capital relocation", or as "relocation of the Diet and other organizations".

In 2017, the Government of Japan decided to move the Agency for Cultural Affairs to Kyoto.
